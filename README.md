# Firebase.Auth.Unofficial
An unofficial package for Firebase Auth, supporting creating users, logging in users, and validating tokens

## Notice

This is using Google Identity Toolkit's APIs directly, the same API's consumed by Firebase's SDKs. These could change! Be careful.

Thank you to @rlamasb and his [Firebase.Xamarin](https://github.com/rlamasb/Firebase.Xamarin/) repo, where I "borrowed" a good chunk of code from.
